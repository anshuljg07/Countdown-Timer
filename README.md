# Countdown-Timer-Assembly
An embedded countdown timer with two 7-segment displays driven by 8-bit shift registers. Users can set a countdown time from 0 to 25 seconds using buttons A and B. The project combines hardware and low-level software components, making it ideal for learning assembly programming, circuit design, and debugging.
